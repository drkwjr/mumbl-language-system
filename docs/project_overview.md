# Mumbl Language Processing System

## Project Overview

The Mumbl Language Processing System is a comprehensive platform designed for collecting, analyzing, and processing linguistic data. This document provides an overview of the system architecture, components, and workflows.

## System Purpose

The primary purpose of the Mumbl system is to create a robust database of language information including:

- Words and their frequency, construction importance, and conversational utility
- Multiple definitions for words with contextual information
- Phonetic data including IPA pronunciation and dialect variations
- Grammar rules categorized by type (syntax, morphology, phonology, semantics)
- Example sentences with complexity and tone metrics
- Data source metadata and reliability tracking
- Language relationships and similarities

## System Architecture

The Mumbl system is composed of several interconnected components:

### 1. PostgreSQL Database

The core of the system is a PostgreSQL database that stores all linguistic data. The database schema is designed to capture the complex relationships between language elements while maintaining data integrity through foreign key relationships and constraints.

### 2. Data Collection (Scrapers)

The system includes Scrapy-based web scrapers that extract linguistic information from various sources:

- **Wiktionary Scraper**: Extracts words, definitions, pronunciations, and example sentences
- Additional scrapers can be added for other data sources

### 3. Processing Subagents

Specialized subagents process and enrich the collected data:

- **Phonetics Agent**: Normalizes IPA notation, analyzes pronunciation patterns, and detects dialect features
- **Grammar Agent**: Categorizes grammar rules, analyzes sentence complexity, and extracts patterns
- **Metadata Agent**: Tracks data sources, assesses reliability, and maintains change history

### 4. Utility Functions

A collection of helper functions provides common functionality across the system, such as:

- Database connections and query execution
- Text normalization and processing
- Data import/export operations
- Logging and error handling

## Data Flow

The typical data flow through the system is as follows:

1. **Data Collection**: Web scrapers extract linguistic data from various sources
2. **Data Storage**: Raw data is stored in the PostgreSQL database
3. **Data Processing**: Subagents process and enrich the data
   - The Phonetics Agent normalizes pronunciation data
   - The Grammar Agent analyzes sentences and grammar rules
   - The Metadata Agent tracks sources and changes
4. **Data Access**: Applications and services can access the processed data via database queries

## System Benefits

The Mumbl Language Processing System offers several benefits:

- **Comprehensive Language Model**: Captures multiple aspects of language in a structured format
- **Data Traceability**: Tracks sources and changes to maintain data quality
- **Flexible Architecture**: Can be extended with additional scrapers and processing agents
- **Rich Linguistic Context**: Stores relationships between words, grammar rules, and usage examples

## Future Directions

Potential future enhancements to the system include:

- **API Layer**: Building a REST API for external applications to access the data
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Adding ML models for language generation and analysis
- **Multi-language Support**: Expanding beyond initial language focus to support more languages
- **User Interface**: Creating a web interface for browsing and editing the linguistic data
- **Speech Synthesis**: Generating audio pronunciations from IPA notation

## Technical Requirements

The system requires:

- PostgreSQL database (version 12+)
- Python 3.8+
- Scrapy for web scraping
- psycopg2 for database connectivity
- NLTK and related libraries for linguistic processing
- Pandas for data manipulation and export

## Getting Started
